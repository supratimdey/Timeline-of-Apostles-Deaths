        <p><span class="cause">Cause of Death</span> Flayed to death by a whip in Armenia.  The cutting of the knife into the body—the entire body—and the removal of the skin is chillingly disturbing. The victim’s natural response to twist and jerk back from the knife would inevitably result in a far from perfect cut—and the knife would remove muscle and tear into ligaments. The entire body would be bleeding out from every avenue. Nerves would be exposed. The mere shock from the pain of this sort of torture is enough to kill the victim.</p>
        <p>Additional Info: Served as a missionary in Asia, particularly in present-day Turkey.</p>
